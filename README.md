Certainly! Here's a README for the `SimpleAccessControl` Solidity contract, suitable for a GitHub repository:

---

# SimpleAccessControl Contract

This repository contains a simple Solidity smart contract demonstrating basic access control mechanisms and error handling using Solidityâ€™s `assert`, `require`, and `revert` functions.

## Contract Overview

The `SimpleAccessControl` contract allows only the owner (the address that deployed the contract) to set a value. It also includes a restricted function that can only be accessed by the owner and performs error handling to ensure certain conditions are met.

## Features

- **Ownership Management:** Only the contract owner can set the stored value.
- **Error Handling:** Uses `require` for input validation and access control, `revert` for complex error conditions, and `assert` for internal error detection.
- **Value Storage and Retrieval:** Allows setting and getting a stored value with access restrictions.

## Contract Code

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.1;

contract SimpleAccessControl {
    address owner;
    uint private storedValue;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function setValue(uint _value) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can set the value");
        storedValue = _value;
    }

    function getValue() public view returns (uint) {
        return storedValue;
    }

    function restrictedFunction() public view {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can access this function");

        if (storedValue == 0) {
            revert("Stored value cannot be zero");
        }
    }

    function assertTest() public pure {
        uint testValue = 1;
        assert(testValue == 1); // This should always be true
    }
}
```

## Deployment and Testing

### Deployment

1. Deploy the `SimpleAccessControl` contract using Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.
2. The deploying address will be set as the owner of the contract.

### Testing `require`

1. **As Owner:**
   - Call `setValue` with a value, e.g., `setValue(10)`.
   - Expected output: Transaction succeeds.

2. **As Non-Owner:**
   - Call `setValue` from a different address (not the owner).
   - Expected output: Transaction fails with the error message "Only the owner can set the value".

### Testing `revert`

1. **Stored Value is Zero:**
   - Ensure `storedValue` is zero (default state or set to zero).
   - Call `restrictedFunction` as the owner.
   - Expected output: Transaction fails with the error message "Stored value cannot be zero".

2. **Stored Value is Non-Zero:**
   - Set `storedValue` to a non-zero value, e.g., `setValue(10)`.
   - Call `restrictedFunction` as the owner.
   - Expected output: Transaction succeeds.

### Testing `assert`

1. Call `assertTest`.
   - Expected output: Transaction succeeds.

2. To see `assert` failure (optional):
   - Modify `assertTest` to `assert(testValue == 0)` and call the function.
   - Expected output: Transaction fails (do not deploy this change to production).

## Usage

To interact with this contract, you can use tools like Remix to deploy and test the contract on Ethereum testnets or local blockchain environments.
